# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression

Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service, based on
how they use the service. Churn rate is an indicator for businesses whose customers are subscribers and
paying for services on a recurring basis. How to keep customer loyalty and prevent customer churn is an
important problem for businesses like banking as different customers exhibit different behaviours and
preferences, so they cancel their subscriptions for various reasons. It is a critical prediction for many
businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. This study utilizes the
Kaggle dataset which contains many features of Customer demographics, Transaction data, and Bank branch
data required for predicting customer churn. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to select the best
features, further models were trained using logistic regression and evaluated using different evaluation
metrics. Our RFE model performed the best with high precision, recall, and AUC score which can help in
identifying those customers that are at risk of cancelling, so the required marketing action can be taken for
each customer to maximize the chances of retaining the customers.
